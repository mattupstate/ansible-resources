Ansible Resources
=================

User contributed playbooks, modules, and articles.  This is a small curated list, but growing.  Everyone is encouraged to add to this document, 
submit a pull request at http://github.com/ansible/ansible-resources.

Ansible Modules
===============

Ansible modules are a way of adding new client-side logic to ansible.  They can be written in any language.

* [Official "core" ansible modules](http://ansible.github.com/modules.html) - various
* [mercurial](https://github.com/bradobro/ansible-module-mercurial) - bradobro
* [zypper (bash module example)](https://github.com/jpmens/ansible-zypp) - jp_mens
* [lineinfile](https://github.com/azemon/ansible/blob/lineinfile/library/lineinfile) - azemon
* [homebrew](https://gist.github.com/3170079) - swehack

Python modules using 0.6 and later can use the common "AnsibleModule" class to dramatically reduce
the amount of boilerplate code required.  Not all modules above yet take advantage of this feature.
See the official documentation for more details.

Selected Playbooks
==================

[Playbooks](http://ansible.github.com/playbooks.html) are ansible's configuration management language.  It should
be easy to write your own from scratch for most applications, but it's always helpful to look at what others have
done for reference.

Scripts
=======

Ansible isn't just a program, it's also an API.  Here's some examples of some clever integrations with the "Runner" and
also Playbook APIs, and integrations with other interesting pieces of software.
